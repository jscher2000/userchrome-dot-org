<div id="main">
<p><strong>This is not a Mozilla site, and is not subject to the Mozilla privacy policy.</strong></p>

<p>You probably realize this, but just in case you didn't, every time you contact a web server, it stores information about your request. This disclosure describes the information stored by my web server in relation to this site, and what I do with it.</p>
<p>The following information is current as of November 18, 2017.</p>

<h2>File Retrieval and Logging</h2>
<p>Every time a file is retrieved from my site, the web server records certain data in its log, including: the file requested; the date and time; the referring page (if applicable); the browser identification string sent with your request; any cookies set by this site and returned with your request; and the IP address associated with your connection to my web server.</p>

<p>(A browser identification string looks more or less like this: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0. As you can see, it usually shows your browser and operating system. You can view some of the data your browser provides to web sites on this page: <a href="https://www.jeffersonscher.com/res/jstest.php">Browser Tests 2016</a>.)</p>

<h2>Use and Storage of Log Information</h2>
<p>This log information may be used to understand which pages on the site are popular and where visitors are in the world (based on the IP address). Currently, the log information is stored indefinitely, and there is no convenient way to remove entries from the logs.</p>

<h2>Cookies, Analytics and Tracking</h2>
<p>My web server may set cookies depending on the files retrieved. I am not aware that these are used for anything, other than to gather statistics about site usage. These pages do not currently use any third party analytics service. This site currently does not behave any differently if your browser sends a "do not track" (DNT) header.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>The comment form has optional fields for your name and email address. If you wish to submit feedback anonymously, do not fill these fields, and do not provide personally identifying information in your comment. The IP address supplied by your computer is stored with your comment and may be checked against spam filtering services in the future. Feedback is stored indefinitely and may be used to improve the site or, if you provide contact information, to contact you. I may hide some comments from visitors to the site, but these hidden comments are not necessarily deleted from data files on the server.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services</h2>
<p>The SHARE and TRANSLATE links load scripts from AddToAny and Google, respectively. Those scripts, and use of the buttons they generate, are subject to their respective privacy policies.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you have any concerns about this statement or your use of this site, you can use the FEEDBACK button or send an email message to jscher2000@outlook.com.</p>
